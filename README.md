# Open Links in Tabs Firefox Extension

Available at [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open_links_in_tabs/)

Opens selected links in new tabs.

That's just it.

**TODO:**

1. Only show context menu when links are selected _(Webextension limitation)_

This is a fork of [Open Selected Links](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-selected-links/?src=search) and all credit for code goes to [Daniel Veditz](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/daniel-veditz/)

I just changed it to have a single context menu item and run the content-scripts at startup.

Thanks @attekemppila for limiting number of concurrent tabs loading _(making it a smoother experience)_
